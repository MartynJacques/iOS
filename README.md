# iOS
A set of programs written whilst learning iOS.

In order to teach myself iOS Programming I worked through
"iOS Programming The Big Nerd Ranch Guide(4th Edition)".

This repo contains all the programs that I wrote whilst
working through the book.

DISCLAIMER: I am not the original designer of any of 
the programs in this repo, all design rights belong 
to the authors/creators of the book.
